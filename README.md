# Machine-learning-classification-regression
Goal of the project was to apply various ML algorithms to build two models. First one explaining the weight of the newborn child and second whether a particular person closed the credit card account. Both models are based on the training sample and generate predictions for all observations from the test sample.

## Data
In this folder you have stored test and training data explaining the weight of the newborn child and a particular person closed the credit card account.

## Regression
First in this part of project you have to run Regression_dataprep_eda.ipynb file where at the beggining and at the end of the file you have to change the path to prepare and then save the already cleaned and ready data.
Then you need to go to the Regression_models.ipynb file where at the beginning you need to set the path to the prepared data and then you will find different models with calculated MAPE statistics that allow you to choose the best model.
The last file called Regression_final.ipynb you can see the model that proved to be the best predictor of data along with the best parameters selected. At the end of the file you need to set the path to save the predictions to a csv file.

## Classification
First in this part of project you have to run classification_dataprep.ipynb file where at the beggining and at the end of the file you have to change the path to prepare and then save the already cleaned and ready data.
Then you need to go to the Regression_final.ipynb file where you can see some models with the best parameters and at the end the model that proved to be the best predictor of data along with the best parameters selected. At the end of the file you need to set the path to save the predictions to a csv file.
